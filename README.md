# Movie-Recommendation-System 

In this implementation, when the user searches for a movie we will recommend the top 5 similar movies using our movie recommendation system.

## About 
We will focus on providing a basic recommendation system in this notebook by recommending items that are most similar to a specific item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind that this is not a complete recommendation system; to put it another way, it simply shows you which movies/items are most similar to the one you selected.

## Approach:
- Here I have used two recommendation system
  - Correlation:
  - Cosine simalarity :
    - Similarity is the cosine of the angle between the 2 vectors of the item vectors of A and B
    - Closer the vectors, smaller will be the angle and larger the cosine
